The present work tries to expose the necessary details to enable the mechanisms of a semi-direct democracy through the use of Blockchain. Which are the binding referendum, the popular legislative initiative, the revocation of the mandate, the plebiscites and public consultations. This document only shows a proposal to enable public consultations in the municipality of Zapopan. The Blockchain Stellar network is used for the development of this research.

Society has changed, however current political systems are still in a process of adaptation, however, this has been very slow and has not adapted to the demands of citizens. That is why a semi-direct democracy will help to improve the existing relationship between rulers and ruled.

The document has the focus of qualitative research. And it clearly exposes the benefits of this system with respect to other options that currently exist, but which do not allow to carry out all the mechanisms of semi-direct democracy.
